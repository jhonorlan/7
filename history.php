                Cainta Catholic College dawned through the CICM missionary zeal. In 1931,
                <?php getPersonLink("Rev. Fr. Jose Tajon", "x-tajon") ?>
                was parish
                priest of Our Lady of Light. Since he ran a school at the Manila Cathedral. his former parish, he deemed
                it
                wise to open a Catholic School so that the children of the town could avail of primary education.
            </p>

            <p>
                From charity money and donation, Fr. Tajon was able to maintain the school free of tuition fee but with
                regularly paid teachers. He indeed established a feat of sort, as he was able to have this arrangement
                even
                during the duration of the Second World War. Enrolment increased each year up to 1944. The pupils were
                housed in three classrooms made of nipa and wood. Before Filipino became a national language, it was
                already
                part already part of the curriculum though the students spoke English just as well. The school produced
                most
                of the leading Catholics in Cainta.
            </p>


            <p>
                All through the pre-war years until the Japanese occupation and the American liberation, classes were
                continuously conducted. But in December 1944, Fr. Tajon died at the Santiago Hospital, during the
                shelling
                for the liberation of Manila. With his death, Cainta Catholic School unfortunately ceased its operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1959, <?php getPersonLink("Fr. Daniel Courtens", "x-daniel2") ?>, another CICM priest, was appointed
                Parish Priest. Having observed the expenses
                and the risk, the youth of Cainta faced in wanting to have a secondary education offered in neighboring
                towns, he decided to re-open Cainta Catholic School. School year 1960 - 1961 began with seventy-four
                students enrolled with important emphasis given to religious instruction and moral formation. Special
                participation in all church activities was stressed as a basis for moral life. Along this line,
                vocational
                education was also provided so the youth can be prepared for earning a livelihood in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, the school was housed in two rooms: one for the boys and one for the girls. In 1963 a new
                building was constructed to house eight classrooms, an administrative office, an adequate library, a
                laboratory and a faculty room. <?php getPersonLink("Fr. Courtens", "x-daniel2") ?> kept the cost of the
                building construction secret, attributing
                it mainly to the Roman Catholic Church and some generous benefactors as sources of funds. In fact,
                people
                wondered as to how the school managed to survive the low fees collected.
            </p>

            <p>
                The year 1964 marks the milestone for Cainta Catholic School. The first batch of forty-four graduates
                received their diplomas. As the populace kept growing there was a need for additional classrooms. The
                old
                Church building was converted into a two-story edifice. A new one was constructed to connect the main
                building with the old church structure. <?php getPersonLink("Fr. Walter de Vilde", "x-walter") ?> who
                took
                over made this possible as parish
                priest and school director in 1965. With the assumption of office of Msgr. Sta. Ana in 1975, CCS became
                a
                two-level school. The Elementary level started with Kinder and Grade 1, and a grade level was opened
                each
                year up to Grade VI.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Pre-Elementary department was opened in the school year 1988-1989 through the initiative of Msgr.
                <?php getPersonLink("Mariano T. Balbago Jr.", "x-staana") ?> who succeeded as parish priest and school
                director. By then the student population
                has reached 7,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 1990's marked more improvements. Computer subject was added to the curriculum of both the elementary
                and
                high school. But religion as core of all subject areas was kept alive and strengthened. Two new
                buildings
                were constructed: the Cardinal Santos and John Paul II.
            </p>

            <p>
                In school year 1996-1997 pursuing the five-year development plan of the school, a college level was
                opened
                offering courses in Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEED) and Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSED).
                Thus, Cainta Catholic School became Cainta Catholic College.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additional courses were opened in College in SY 1997-1998: BS Commerce major in Finance and BS Computer
                Science. Two courses are ladderized courses: Associate in Religious Education and Certificate in
                Computer
                Secretarial (Two-year course).
            </p>

            <p>
                Facilities were improved. K1 and K2 rooms were air-conditioned. An Administrative Building was built to
                house all offices. There is no end to growth for Cainta Catholic College as it works for the attainment
                of
                its Vision, Mission, Goals and Objectives. Cainta Catholic College as an institution of learning and
                human
                formation, faithful to its Vision-Mission adheres to and believes in the fulfillment of the different
                core
                values as mandate to make these values a living school culture.
            </p>

            <p>
                In September 17, 1997, <?php getPersonLink("Rev. Fr. Efren C. Villanueva", "x-efrenv") ?> was
                appointed
                as the new
                College President. Believing in
                the school's potential for development and excellence, the president instituted reforms in an
                encompassing
                fashion. In academics, a progressive development upgrading instruction and curriculum was instituted
                simultaneously with the professionalization of teaching academic staff by sending a sizeable number of
                teachers for post graduate studies at DLSU specializing in different fields.
            </p>

            <p>
                Information Technology and computer education were substantially enhanced introducing the state of the
                art
                hardware and software to fully automate offices. State of the art laboratories in science, computer and
                speech alongside with the new technology and home economics building were constructed. Human resource
                management and center for integral evangelization offices were also created, professionalized and
                systematized.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the new millenium approaches, a new president of the institution was installed in the person of <?php getPersonLink("Rev. Fr.
                Paquito G. Gallego.", "x-pax") ?> The installation, last Nov. 30, 1999, was done during the Holy
                Sacrifice of
                the Mass
                celebrated by the Most Rev. Protacio G. Gungon, DD. The entrance of Fr. Pax to the school paved the way
                to
                widen the horizon towards academic excellence which the school primarily desires. The Academic personnel
                were empowered to particularly focus on the curriculum and discipline, the school's well-being and
                standard,
                with special emphasis on the cleanliness of the school. For all of these to be implemented and run like
                a
                well-oiled machine, he gathered all the heads and supervisors of all the departments to form the
                President's
                Council and appointed Bro. Joel C. Javiniar and Atty. Carmencita P.L. Logan to be the Executive
                Assistants
                for Academic Affairs and for Institutional Planning and Development, respectively. Likewise, he
                appointed
                Mrs. Cecilia V. Vinluan to be the Executive Assistant for Student Services.
            </p>

            <p>
                With both the Academic and Administrative departments in place, the construction of the new THE building
                was
                realized; the former Accounting and College offices inside the Administration Building were transformed
                into
                classrooms for the College Department. Since the Perpetual Adoration Chapel is located outside the
                school
                campus, the former office of the Property Custodian was refurbished into a prayer room for the spiritual
                needs of both the students and the employees alike. Meanwhile, the President's office was transferred to
                the
                2nd floor of the former T.H.E. building, and the HRMD took over the vacated President's office. In
                February
                9, 2004, Cainta Catholic College, then a Parochial school, was elevated to the status of a Diocesan
                College.
                This important phase in the indelible history of the institution is attributed to the initiative of Fr.
                Gallego and the resolution of the Board of Trustees led by Most Rev. Fr. Gabriel V. Reyes, Bishop of
                Antipolo, accorded CCC all the rights and privileges of a Diocesan College as provided by the Canon Law.
                In
                this same year CCC worked on Self Survey to prepare for accreditation.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the institution celebrates its Tri-Fest, making seventy five years from the first year it was founded
                as
                a catholic primary school, the tenth year of the college department, and the closing of the Sapphire
                year of
                the high school department,
                <?php getPersonLink("Msgr. Arnel F. Lagarejos", "arnelsolo") ?> was installed President of
                Cainta Catholic College and
                at the same time the parish priest of the Our Lady of Light Parish in June by the Most Rev. Gabriel V.
                Reyes, Bishop of Antipolo. With his assumption into office great strides were taken to fulfill the
                vision
                and mission of CCC.
            </p>

            <p>
                In November 29, 2006 Cainta Catholic College was accorded level one accreditation by the Philippine
                Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on accreditation (PACUCOA), a quest the institution
                has
                prepared for so many years.
            </p>

            <p>
                To provide basic quality service to the CCC academic community, a variety of management techniques were
                initiated. A revisit of the VISION-MISSION of the institution in the light of the new challenges for CCC
                after accreditation was done resulting to a revised statement of vision and mission. General assemblies
                and
                focused group discussions were conducted as means for consultation, cascading, and eventual owning of
                the
                vision and mission.
            </p>

            <p>
                The management spearheaded the conduct of a Staff Management Audit resulting to well-informed management
                decisions. Customer Services Survey and Performance Evaluation of School Administrators were carried out
                to
                gauge the level of satisfaction of students and personnel in the services provided by school offices and
                administrators. These measures resulted in the streamlining the organization for a more efficient and
                effective delivery of quality Catholic education. The tuition and miscellaneous fees were rationalized
                by
                lowering the miscellaneous fees as a way to open access to CCC education. Children of employees were
                granted
                tuition fee discounts as incentives to their committed service to CCC.
            </p>

            <p>
                Development of Cainta Catholic College is continuous and inspired by the hopes and dreams of its
                academic
                community. With concerted efforts CCC may still realize the dream of offering health allied courses,
                achieving Level I-Formal Accreditation, increase in the number of satisfied parents and students, and a
                lot
                more. With the intercession of Mary, Our Lady of Light, May Cainta Catholic College truly become a
                community
                of Christ's faithful in communion and mission of proclaiming the gospel values of Truth, Justice and
                Love.
            </p>

            <p>
                Last August 14, 2017, Rev. Fr. Gerard Joaquin V. Masangya, Superintendent of Catholic Schools in the
